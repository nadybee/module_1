# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Module_1 Challenge Assignment

### These are the improvements I made to the code
• Added a descriptive title to website
• reordered head tags to be more standard 
• Added semantic tags including header, main, section and footer
• Fixed the a tag links to work by giving the proper id's to where its linked to
• Removed imgs from CSS and embedded them in the html
• Added alt tags to all the photos and icons
• simplified CSS classes by cutting repeat code  
• moved html folder to the root folder so gitpages would work. Change all the href to make it work.
